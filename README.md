WhatsApp-A-Mole is an interactive and fun game that is curated for all age groups. The aim of the game is to make users aware about their privacy and security. This is done through questions about privacy and security on WhatsApp and whacking the correct mole. The game leverages its uniquely custom made art style to make it appropriate to all age groups. The younger generations can enjoy it with the visual activity and gamification aspect while the throwback arcade style appeals to the older generations.
